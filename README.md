Bonner Family Archive

<b>Template inspired by Shaif Arfan </b>

My first actual solicited project was, naturally enough, for family. The Irish side of the family tree had a stack of family history items scattered about, and much of it kept getting lost and then reappearing. I was asked to compile and preserve this material, and a website seemed to be the perfect vehicle for this request.
